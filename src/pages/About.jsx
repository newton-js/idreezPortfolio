            Hello! my name is Idreez and i have fun coding. From the moment
            I wrote my first line of code, I Knew I was hooked into the world of
            software development.

            But software development has never been ''just a job'' for me, it's
            offered an engaging challenge, which leads to constant learning and
            improvement to create high-quality software. What started with a
            simple line of code has become a full-fledged passion that only gets
            more exciting as time goes by.
          </P>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default About;
